# Tilemap Adventure
 
This is my third project.

It's a straightforward 2D platformer game. So the rules are the same as in other 2D platformers.

I made this project to practice making tile maps. and attempt to create a 2D platformer. So, seeing how quick the gameplay is, it's sort of like a testing project.
